# Step Machine

`machine` is an implementation of the AWS State Machine specification. The primary goal of this implementation is to enable testing of state machines and code together.

### Continuing Development

Step at the moment is still very beta, and its API will likely change more before it stabilizes. If you have ideas for improvements please reach out.

Some of the TODOs left for the library are:

1. Support for Parallel States
1. Better Validations e.g. making sure all states are reachable and executable
1. Client side visualization of state machine and execution using GraphViz
